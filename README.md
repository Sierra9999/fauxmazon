# Fauxmazon ðŸ›’

Fauxmazon is a fake store API built with the Phoenix framework in Elixir. It provides a simple and scalable solution for managing products and serving them via a RESTful API. Please note that this project is currently in development.

## About Fauxmazon

Fauxmazon simulates the functionality of an e-commerce platform, allowing users to interact with a catalog of products via HTTP endpoints. It provides basic operations for retrieving product information, searching for products, and filtering products by category.

### Product Interface

Products in the Fauxmazon API have the following properties:

- **ID**: A unique identifier for the product.
- **Name**: The name or title of the product.
- **Description**: A brief description of the product.
- **Price**: The price of the product.
- **Category**: The category or type of the product.
- **Brand**: The brand or manufacturer of the product.
- **Stock**: The current stock or inventory of the product.
- **Image URL**: The URL of an image representing the product.
- **Rating**: The average rating of the product (if applicable).

### Entry Points

1. **Get All Products**: <br/>
  ```[GET] http://localhost:4000/products```

3. **Search By Category**: <br/>
