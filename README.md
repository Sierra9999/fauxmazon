# Fauxmazon ðŸ›’

Fauxmazon is a fake store API built with the Phoenix framework in Elixir. It provides a simple and scalable solution for managing products and serving them via a RESTful API. Please note that this project is currently in development.
Fauxmazon simulates the functionality of an e-commerce platform, allowing users to interact with a catalog of products via HTTP endpoints. It provides basic operations for retrieving product information, searching for products, and filtering products by category.
